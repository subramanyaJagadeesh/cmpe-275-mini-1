# Java - 3code lab

This java sub-project may be the best starting point for those 
more familar with java coding. The other sub-projects follow 
similar organization so, understanding one helps create a 
foundation for the others where Python or C/C++ is new.

## Requirements

To compile and run this project you will need:

   * JDK 11 or newer
   * bash (sh) scripting
   * An IDE is optional but helpful.

## Hints

* Each README provides some additional or perspective of the 
  code.
* Run outside of an IDE. Really. Reliance on the IDE shows
  poor foo. 
* When considering hardening the code, what can make the
  code more robust to errors? What corner cases should you
  consider?
